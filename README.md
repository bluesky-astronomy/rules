# Astronomy Feed Rules

Anyone posting to the Astronomy feeds must follow the rules below:

### 1. You must be a professional/amateur/student astronomer or an astronomy organization to post to the feeds.
> It's also ok if you left academia but still want to sign up. You are still an astronomer and you are welcome here!

### 2. Be respectful of others in the community.
> We won't tolerate discrimination of any kind; that means no racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any other kind of discrimination.

### 3. Content that you post to the feeds must be appropriate, scientifically accurate, and not spam.
> No misinformation/impersonation, no spamming, and no off-topic posts. Ask a moderator if you aren't sure.

### 4. Attribute content that is not your own.
> You must credit the original author of any content you post. Whenever possible, you should link to the original author's content.

### 5. Sales-related rules: we support independent creators, but the feeds are still primarily for astronomy.
> Independent creators are welcome to use the feeds to promote or sell their work, as long as it is relevant to our community.
> However, we expect that most (~90%) of your posts should not be direct sales, and we ask you to limit promotional posts to no more than once a day on the main Astronomy feed.
