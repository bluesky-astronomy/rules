# Astronomy Feed Rules

Anyone posting to the Astronomy feeds must follow the rules below:

### 1. You must be a professional, amateur, or student astronomer to post to the feeds.
> It's also ok if you left academia but still want to sign up. You are still an astronomer and you are welcome here!

### 2. Be respectful of others in the community.
> We won't tolerate discrimination of any kind; that means no racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any other kind of discrimination.

### 3. Content that you post to the feeds must be appropriate, accurate, and not spam.
> No misinformation/impersonation, no spamming, and no off-topic posts. Ask a moderator if you aren't sure.

### 4. Attribute content that is not your own.
> You must credit the original author of any content you post. Where possible, you should link to the original author's content.
