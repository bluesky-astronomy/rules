# Astronomy Feed Rules

Anyone posting to the Astronomy feeds must follow the rules below:

### 1. To post to the feeds, you must be a professional, amateur, or student in astronomy, astrophysics, astrobiology, planetary science, or astronomy education — or an astronomy-related organization.
> It’s also OK if you left academia but still want to sign up.

### 2. Be respectful of others in the community.
> We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind; that means no racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any other kind of discrimination.

### 3. Content you post to the feeds must be appropriate, scientifically accurate, and not spam.
> No off-topic posts, no misinformation/impersonation, and no repetitive or overly promotional material, which clutters the feeds and detracts from meaningful interactions. Ask a moderator if you aren’t sure whether a post would be appropriate.

### 4. Attribute content that is not your own.
> You must credit the original author/creator of any content you post. Whenever possible, link to the original author/creator’s content.

### 5. Posting of AI-generated or AI-enhanced content is generally not allowed, and must always be disclosed as being AI-generated.
> AI images or content may only be posted in the context of scientific discussion, and must always be disclosed as having been generated with AI. 
>
> In general, images that are artificially enhanced with AI are also not allowed, as they detract from the hard work that many astrophotographers do to capture photons authentically.

### 6. Only limited promotion of items for sale is allowed - and they must be astronomy-related.
> Independent creators may use the feeds occasionally to promote or sell their astronomy-related work.
> 
> We ask you to limit your promotional posts to no more than once per day on the main Astronomy feed. Promotional posts should not be the majority of your contributions to the feeds.
